# Clinical Quality Language

CQF项目的新进展，这种当作language的提法还是蛮新颖的。             
The Clinical Quality Language (CQL) specification defines a representation for the 
expression of clinical knowledge that can be used within both the Clinical 
Decision Support (CDS) and Clinical Quality Measurement (CQM) domains.

This repository contains the CQL grammar file, ELM UML / schemas, examples, and 
proof-of-concept code for working with CQL.
